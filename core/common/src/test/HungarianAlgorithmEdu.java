 *
 * This Java class implements the Hungarian algorithm [a.k.a Munkres' algorithm,
 * a.k.a. Kuhn algorithm, a.k.a. Assignment problem, a.k.a. Marriage problem,
 * a.k.a. Maximum Weighted Maximum Cardinality Bipartite Matching].
 *
 * This is an educational version of the algorithm, intended to help 
 * those who would like to understand how the algorithm internally works.
 * [I do NOT explain WHY the algorithm does the things it does, just
 * WHAT it does.] If you want to get rid of the comments and tutorial
 * character of this program, get the clean Hungarian algorithm from
 * the same website you got this one (http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~kostas/dev/soft/munkres.htm).
 * The clean version can be used as a method call from within any main
 * or other function.
 * 
 * Any comments, corrections, or additions would be much appreciated. 
 * Credit due to professor Bob Pilgrim for providing an online copy of the
 * pseudocode for this algorithm (http://216.249.163.93/bob.pilgrim/445/munkres.html)
 * 
 * Feel free to redistribute this source code, as long as this header--with
 * the exception of sections in brackets--remains as part of the file.
 * 
 * Requirements: JDK 1.5.0_01 or better.

		//is a bit difficult and you need to only if you are a computer science major. Here,
		//I will just try to superficially explain how it works inside so that you understand
		//what is basically happening.

		//	a. Let path(i,j) represent the last uncovered primed zero found in Step 4. If you
		//     remember, we stored its coordinates in the zero_RC array.
		//	b. Let path(i+1,j) denote the starred zero in the column of path(i,j)(if any).
		//	   (When we say in the column, we mean in the column of the mask matrix).
		//	c. Let path(i+2,j) denote the primed zero in the row of path(i+1,j)
		//	   (there will always be one) (Again with row, we mean row of mask matrix).
		//	d. Continue until the series terminates at a primed zero that has no starred
		//	   zero in its column.
		//	e. Unstar each starred zero of the series and star each primed zero of the series.
		//	f. Erase all primes (if any other primes exist in the mask matrix).
		//	g. Uncover every row and column
		//	h. Return to step 3.
