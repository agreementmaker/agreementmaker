package am.api.matching;


/**
 * <p>
 * An interface to store similarities computed by a
 * {@link am.api.matching.MatchingAlgorithm matching algorithm}. Entities in the
 * source ontology are along the rows, and entities in the target ontology are
 * along the columns.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, in the matrix below, the similarity between source concept
 * <code>sC</code> and target concept <code>tC</code> is <code>1.0</code>.
 * <code>sA<code> has index of 0, <code>sB</code> has index of 1, and so on.
 * Likewise, <code>tA</code> has index 0, <code>tB</code> has index 1, and so
 * on. To get the similarity between <code>sC</code> and <code>tC</code>
 * directly, you can call <code>getSimilarity(2,2)</code> or
 * <code>getSimilarity(sC.getIndex(), tC.getIndex())</code>.
 * </p>

 * <pre>
 *                  tA  tB  tC   ...
