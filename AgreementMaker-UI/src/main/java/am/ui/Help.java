		result+="This Help is just a brief introduction to the AgreementMaker. Can be useful to watch the video available on the distribution website. Additional details can be found at www.cs.uic.edu/Cruz/Publications#2009 .\n\n";
		
		result += "1) Load source and target ontologies.\n\n";
		
		result += "First open source and target ontologies by clicking on File->Open Source/Target Ontology, and selecting filepath and format.\n";
		result += "I3CON2004 example ontologies contained in the AM distribution are OWL-N3.\n";
		result += "OAEI-2009 example ontologies contained in the AM distribution are OWL-RDF/XML.\n";
		result += "GEOSPATIAL are XML ontologies\n";
		result += "\n";
		
		result += "2) Browse ontologies\n\n";
		
		result += "Click on a concept node to select it. Click everywhere in the canvas to deselect all. In the description panel on the right is possible to visualize additional informations.\n";
		result += "In a OWL ontology following informations are available: localname, label, comment, seeAlso, isDefinedBy, properties, and individuals\n";
		result += "Class and Property hierarchy are displayed in the canvas.\n";
		result += "In a XML ontology: localname = tag id, label = tag label, comment = tag exp, seeAlso = tag seeAlso, and isDefBy = tag isDefBy, no properties or individuals.\n";
		result += "All xml concepts are displayed as a unique class hierarchy.\n";
		result += "Concepts with multiple ancestors will be duplicated and shown more then once, but they will be aligned once.\n";

		result += "3)Run matchers to perform matchings.\n\n";
		
		result += "All matchers are available in the matchers selection menu. Click on details button to view a brief description of the selected matcher, not always available.\n";
		result += "To run the selected matcher click on the Match button.Common parameters like threshold and number of relations has to be set before the match operations. Default values are automatically selected.\n";
		result += "Any matcher will perform the similarity between each source concept with each target concept building a similarity matrix.\n";
		result += "Alignments will be selected from the matrix if their similarity is higher then the threshold, and if they satisfy the maximal number or relations for source and target.\n";
		result += "This process is done for classes and matrix if the matcher align both.\n";
		result += "Each matcher will be saved in a new row of the table of the control panel. From there is possible to modify parameters after the execution.Is it also possible to delete matchers.\n";
		result += "Some matchers can run just with common parameters, Some other need more parameters that will be required by the proper panel.\n";
		result += "Some matchers requires other matching result in input, so is not possible to run them without having run other matcher first.\n";
		result += "Matchers that can run first are Base_similarity or Parametric String matcher, while DSI and SSC must run after selecting the output of a previous one.\n";
		result += "\n";
		
		result += "4) Manual mappings.\n\n";
		
		result += "Is it possible to add new mappings or edit mappings generated by any matcher.\n";
		result += "Select source nodes and target nodes that needs to be aligned using left click and optionally shift or ctrl for multiple selections.\n";
		result += "A popup menu will appear which allow the user to create a standard mapping 100% similarity or to create any kind of mapping inserting the required similiraty value.\n";
		result += "Is it also possible to modify the similarity or to delete a previous generated mapping.\n";
		result += "If no matchers are selected in the table, then all manual changes will be applied only to the User Manual Matcher.\n If any other matcher is selected then manual changes will be applied to all of them.\n";

		result += "\n";
		
		result += "5) Combine matchings.\n\n";
		
		result += "Matchings can be combined with the 'Manual Combination Matcher'. Select serveral matchings from the matchers table and run the matcher.\n";
		result += "A new similarity matrix will be built from the matrices of the matchers in input.Different operations are available to calculate a new similarity for each pair of source and target nodes.\n";
		result += "Maximum, Minimun, average or weighted average of the similarity of each matcher in input for each source and target node.\n";
		result += "An automatic quality based combination technique is being studied, but is not ready yet.\n";
		result+= "\n";
		
		result += "6) Evaluate matchings with a reference file.\n\n";
		
		result += "A reference file is a set of mappings given by a domain expert which includes all correct alignments for a source and target ontology.\n";
		result += "All sample ontologies in the distribution have a reference file (e.g. WeaponsA and WeaponsB have the reference file WeaponsAB),\n";
		result += "Evaluating a matching means comparing the sets of alignments found with perfect set of alignments of the reference.Different measure are given.\n";
		result += "Recall = #correct / #found . Precision = #correct/#reference_mappings, F-Measure = (2*Precision+recall) / Precision * Recall\n";
		result += "Changing threshold will affect these measures significantly, increasing it increases precision and decreases recall and vice-versa.\n";
		result += "To evaluate a matcher select it, run reference evaluation selecting the reference file with the corresponding format.If the reference file contains 0 alignments it probably means that the wrong format has been chosen.\n";
		result += "Is it also possible to visualize reference alignments in the canvas running the reference alignment matcher.\n";
		result += "\n";
		
		result += "7) Save alignments into a file.\n\n";
		
		result += "It is possible to save the alignments into an XML, DOC or TXT file. XLS it the better for visualizing them.\n";
		result += "Just select matchings to be saved, click save and select filename, destionation and extension. Remember to not put any dot or wrong characters in the name.\n";
