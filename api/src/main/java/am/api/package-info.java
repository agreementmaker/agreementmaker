/**
 * <p>This bundle represents the AgreementMaker API.</p>  
 * 
 * <p>
 * This API takes some inspiration from the <a href="http://alignapi.gforge.inria.fr">Alignment API</a>,
 * and also the <a href="http://semanticmatching.org">S-Match system</a>.  Adapting one of these APIs 
 * was considered, however none of them seemed to fit the current vision of AgreementMaker.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Sub-package description:
 * <ul>
 * <li><u>ontology</u> - API interfaces related to representing ontologies.</li>
 * <li><u>alignment</u> - API interfaces related to representing an alignment.</li>
 * <li><u>matching</u> - API interfaces related to matching algorithms (algorithms which compute similarity values).</li>
 * <li><u>selection</u> - API interfaces related to selection algorithms (algorithms which produce an alignment from a similarity matrix).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Due to the heterogeneity in terminology between the APIs, below will be presented a mapping 
 * between the terms of the different APIs, to the best of our ability.
 * </p>
