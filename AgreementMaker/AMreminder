                            AgreementMaker Reminder

An informal reminder of features to be added or corrected in the AM.
Fell free to take care of any of these problems or to add anything new to these document.

This is the structure, feel free to add infos to it:

****OAEI 2009
some benchmarks testcases don't work because the AM is not able to load the ontologies
The DSI method should be changed to work on non-tree structure (mcp sim + (1 -MCP) (sum(maxdsi(eachparent)/numparents)
The VMM should consider vectors differently
Find a way to merge diff results in Conference track
Make the distrib directory and the Jar available online
Find a way to make use of the partial reference alignment to have a better result in Anatomy 4.
In psm and VMM seeAlso and isDefined by are not set with a reference to the concept 
We could make that only the last layer of methods perform the selection of mappings all others just work on the matrices


****TODO

--Matchings

----First layer
----Second layer
----Third layer and other

--UserInterface
seeAlso and isdefBy URI, label, e comment shoud be shown in the right panel on only the label

-----Matchings

__________FIRST LAYER

    To have more ideas for this remember to look at [1] that has many starting point and references.
    Is also important to look at Ontology Matching workshop 2008, which has many papers.
    and OAEI 2008 which contains result and references of other tools
    we should look at RIMOM and DSSIM
    
    EXTENSIONAL INSTANCE BASED [1] 3.4  OR [2]
    this work only on classes. if you implement this leave alignProp to true and set the matrix to all 0.
    compare the set of instances of the two classes, i would consider only the direct instances that are contained in an ArrayList in each node
	you can use a symmetric distance. I don't know if jaccard similarity can be applied.
	Before using symmetric distance since it only considers equivalence between names is important to preprocess strings, like in the param string matcher
	
	You can also use a similarity measure like the one used for SSC.
	So basically given two sets of instances you build the matrix of sim between these two sets, using for example edit distance between each string.
 	And then the final sim is:  avg(max value for each source instance with all target instances)
 	
 	if the instances names are long, another way could be:
 	build a big string composed by concatenating all instances names.
 	Then preprocess that string. Then tokenize. Then comparing the two vector of strings obtained with TF/IDF technique. [1] [2]
	
	ALL INFORMATION AT THE SAME TIME [3] 
	concatenate with a space between them all the strings: localname, label, comment, isdefby, seealso, all label of properties (for prop all label of classes),
	all instances, father label, siblings labels, sons labels.
	
	Preprocess this big string with the same preprocessing of the parametric string matcher (with everything true in the param)
	Tokenize this string when finding a space. 
	So now you have a big vector of strings to be compared with TF/IDF technique to the big vector of the string of the target
	

__________SECOND LAYER

	DSI
	Correct the DSI to be working on multiple ancestors hierarchy.
	The formula should be MCP*inputSim + AVGofAllPossiblePath((1-mcp)*SUMMARY)
	We also have to check that if one of the two nodes has no fathers this method should return MCP*inputSim.
	However the DSI formula gives very similar result then using this recursive formula
	that would be much faster: 
	if(nodes have no fathers) return inputSim;
	else return mcp*inputSim + (1 -MCP)* DSI of fathers
	this is something that Isabel maybe should know.
	
	DESCENDANTS METHOD
	we are already looking at fathers and siblings but we don't have one that look at descendants.
	So we should have a method similar to SSC that look at them. The formula could be:
	ALG(a,b) = MCP*inputSim + (1-MCP) avg(for each son of A consider the max of similarities with with son of B)
	If a and/or B have no sons the algorithm must return MCP*inputSim.
	
	PROPERTY AND CLASS REDISTRIBUTION
	This algorithm should process classes and properties differently.
	Basically classes sim will be increased if the properties of that class are similar and
	properties sim will be increased if the classes of that property are similar.
	so formula could be similar to SSC again:
	
	sim(A,B):
		CLASSES
		if(A and/or B has no prop then return inputSim)
		else for each prop of A{ //there is a list of properties localnames in each class node
				search for that prop in the property node list //localname is unique so it can be done
				consider the max sim of this prop with target's properties //there is a method in the alignmentMatrix class to find a max of a row
			return MCP * inputSIM +	(1-MCP) avg(of the values found in the previous for)
		
			
		PROPERTIES is the same but directed to classes
		for each property scan classes to find classes which contains this property //again uses the property list of each class node
		 	for each class found find the max //use the method in matrix to find the max
		again return MCP * inpuSim + (1 -MCP) avg(of the values found in the previous for)
		
	
	However all these methods are structural and other similar to these are described in the
	[1] section 3.3.2
				
__________THIRD LAYER AND OTHER


	
	Matching combination
	I'm trying to work on it... I'm looking at a Weighted Average of mappings found, where weights are assigned via quality evaluation
	The hard part is to find a quality evaluation: 	[4][5]
	Another way to assign weights could be looking at the ontologies  [6][7][8]
	
	1-1 mapping
	right now the stable marriage algorithm is implemented to solve 1-1 and N-M pairing but is not
	the optimal algo for the 1-1.
	The Optimization problem is called Assignment Problem, it can be reduced to find the 
	Maximum Matching on a Bipartite Weighted Graph. Info on this can be found on wikipedia, which has reference to a book.
	This problem can be solved with the Shortest Augmenting Path algorithm. 
	We should find a Java Graph Library which has this alg implemented.
	LEDA is a C++ lib which has the Maximum Weighted Bipartite Matching, and as far as i understood it
	is possible to access LEDA functions also by java because it uses the "extern" mode, but it maybe risky.
	The book: "A Java library for Graph algorithm", has a chapter on the "assignment problem" and i think
	they implemented a java library too. So if we access this book we may find a solution.
	If we find a good description of the algorithm we can also implement it by ourself just using one of the
	java library for graph like JGraphT which has a shortest path algorithm implemented.
	If you find anything let me know. In all cases the stable marriage we have now is more than ok for now.	
	
	Matcher based on a small reference.
	could be an improvement matcher.
	For example we may use it to define the value of threshold to be used at the end.
	This matcher runs the matcher in input with serveral threshold values. Evaluate the results with 
	the small reference and undestand the best threshold to be used.
	could be a comb matcher.
	it evaluate all the input matchers with small ref and combine them using as weight the F-Measure.
	

---UserInterface

	The displayed string
	We are always displaying localnames in the vertex. 
	But localnames are ID and they may be just codes sometimes.
	While the label is the human readable version of localnames.
	In most of the cases those are the same. Sometimes label is missing.
	But sometimes (like anatomy track ontos) localnames are just codes.
	So we should be able to display inside each vertex:
	1)localname 2) label 3) localname - label
	We should add 2 checkbox in the view menu to let the user set which one to view.
	We should have a method in Vertex class: getDisplayedName which looks at that option
	and return getNode().getLocalName() or getNode().getLabel or the concatenation of both.
	So the canvas should always access this method of vertex to display names.
	
	Visualization Panel.
	We should add a visualization panel (similar to matcher selection panel) on top of canvas or
	on top of control panel.
	The main functionality should be the search. A textarea and a button search. This feature should
	search for the first node that has that string contained in the localname or label or comment.
	Select it and scroll to it. If the user continue to search this function should continue serching for the next node.
	So basically it should first look over all source nodes after the selected one and then after all target nodes.
	There should also be an advanced seach button, which open a dialog which let you insert input for 
	advanced search like: search exact or partial, class or prop tree, into label comment or individuals and so on.
	In the vis panel we could also add the check box for SMO mode, and displayed string mode.
	
	Changing the reference alignment matcher into import file functionatlity.
	Basically the "reference alignment" matcher shouldn't be in the selection.
	There should be an import button which let you open a file showing alignments (using the ref alignment matcher).
	there should be an export button which let you save the file in the txt: \tsource-->\ttarget format
	so that we can then re-display later any of the calculated matchings.
	Unfortunatly a full export import of all matchings and their status is quite complicated and would require a lot of more work from
	developers because the would have to implement serialize() and deserialize() in the paramater class. I think we have other
	priorities even though it would be usefull to make test and reuse experiments.
	
	Same color for matched nodes mode.
	Will underwood suggested to have this mode to highlight mapped nodes.
	Basically when this mode is active, each matched node as a random color but nodes that are matched between each other have the same.
	Oviusly when this mode is on, the color of matchers becomes irrelevant.
	
	We may also need the align only selected nodes mode.
	Basically when activated any matcher will be working on selected nodes.
	To make adding less changes as possible, we just have to change the abstract matcher constructor.
	If the mode is activated instead of setting source and target ontology. It create a new source and target ont only with selected nodes.
	However this may need a lot of test to integrate with all the other features.
	
	We may need a view/edit matrix feature which show the class or prop sim matrix of a matcher in a table.
	This is good for developers to test algorithms, but users can directly modify similarity from there too.
	
	We may also need a view alignment list dialog, which show the alignment of a matcher into a table.
	
	Canvas should be divided in 2 scrollpanes. (later)
	
	
	
	
***************************BUGS**********************************
1) the matcher selection panel and bottom panel in the control one have a problem in the layout.
If the window is small and buttons doesn't fit in it they just disappear, while they should be moved down in that case.

2) sometime the exec time is not correct. Probably on very slow matchers like base_withdict.

4)The xls file saved with the save funct on a computer in the lab couldn't get opened. maybe is just an old excel.
